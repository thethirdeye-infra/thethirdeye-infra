# Execution Under Pressure

Systems do not fail when conditions are ideal.
They fail when time is limited, information is incomplete,
and consequences are irreversible.

## Pressure Is the Baseline

If a system only works when:
- inputs are clean
- timelines are flexible
- actors are honest

then it is not infrastructure.
It is a demo.

## What Survives Pressure

Deterministic systems survive pressure because they provide:
- bounded execution paths
- reproducible outcomes
- verifiable artifacts
- post-hoc accountability

Pressure does not break such systems.
It reveals them.

## My Position

I do not design for optimal conditions.
I design for:
- hostile environments
- asymmetric information
- legal scrutiny
- irreversible decisions

If a system cannot explain itself under pressure,
it should not be trusted without it.
