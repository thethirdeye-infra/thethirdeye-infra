# Court-Ready Outputs

An output is only valuable if it survives external verification.

## What "Court-Ready" Means

- Hash-linked artifacts (SHA-256)
- Immutable timestamps
- Reproducible generation
- Clear chain of custody

## What Is Not Acceptable

- Screenshots
- Manual summaries
- Non-replayable dashboards
- Analyst-only interpretations

## Why This Matters

In adversarial environments, intent is irrelevant.
Only verifiable facts survive.

## My Position

If an output cannot be independently verified,
it should never be used to make decisions.
