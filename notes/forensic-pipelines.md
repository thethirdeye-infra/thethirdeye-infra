# Forensic Pipelines

A forensic system is not defined by how it looks,
but by whether its outputs survive hostile scrutiny.

## Core Requirements

- Deterministic execution
- Hash-linked artifacts
- Time-bound evidence
- Replayable analysis paths

## Why Pipelines Matter

Manual analysis does not scale.
Dashboards do not prove anything.

Pipelines do.

They ensure that:
- the same input produces the same output
- evidence can be regenerated years later
- results are defensible in court

## My Position

If an analysis cannot be reproduced,
it is not analysis — it is opinion.
