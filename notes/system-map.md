# System Map

This repository documents principles and constraints.
Not implementations.

## Layers

1. **Inputs**
   - On-chain transaction data
   - Wallet graphs
   - External signals (time, ordering, provenance)

2. **Processing**
   - Deterministic pipelines
   - Explicit state transitions
   - Hash-linked execution steps

3. **Outputs**
   - Risk scores
   - Cluster attributions
   - Court-ready forensic reports

## Guarantees

- Same input → same output
- Every transformation is traceable
- Every artifact is verifiable
- Every decision can be replayed

## Non-Goals

- Visualization-first systems
- Black-box ML inference
- Narrative-driven confidence
- Irreversible hidden logic

## Philosophy

If a system cannot explain itself under pressure,
it should not be trusted in production.
