# TheThirdEye™ — Infrastructure & Forensic Systems

I build **deterministic infrastructure** for environments where  
*visuals fail, narratives collapse, and correctness is mandatory.*

---

## Focus

- **Blockchain Forensics**
- **Risk & Cluster Analysis**
- **Deterministic Pipelines**
- **Court-Ready Outputs (SHA-256, timestamped, verifiable)**

Dashboards do not reduce risk.  
**Deterministic outputs do.**

---

## What I Work On

- Large-scale wallet & transaction graph analysis  
- Risk scoring pipelines under adversarial conditions  
- Immutable forensic reporting (PDF, hash-verifiable)  
- Systems designed for **audit, law enforcement, and compliance**

No growth hacks.  
No hype layers.  
No opaque ML decisions.

---

## Design Principles

- Correctness over speed  
- Determinism over prediction  
- Verifiability over persuasion  
- Infrastructure over interfaces  

If a result cannot be verified independently, it is **not shipped**.

---

## Status

This profile intentionally exposes **infrastructure signals only**.  
Source code, reports, and system components are published selectively.
